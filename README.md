## Introduction
This is the Tensile Test Ontology (TTO) as developed in the joint project Platform MaterialDigital ([PMD](https://materialdigital.de/)) on the basis of the testing standard ISO 6892-1: Metallic materials - Tensile Testing - Part 1: Method of test at room temperature. The TTO provides conceptualizations valid for the description of tensile tests and corresponding data, including metadata, in accordance with the corresponding test standard. It is semantically based on the PMD Core Ontology ([PMDco](https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology)) 3.0.0. 

TTO at GitHub: https://github.com/materialdigital/tensile-test-ontology

This publication offers valuable insights into the development process of domain ontologies, illustrated by the example of the tensile test. Starting with the basics of Semantic Web technologies (SWT) and ontologies as well as considerations on mechanical characterization methods, the TTO development process and aspects such as the storage and retrieval of interoperable, FAIR data by means of data mapping and querying are presented in detail. Hence, this pulication may be an essential reference for users and contributors.
