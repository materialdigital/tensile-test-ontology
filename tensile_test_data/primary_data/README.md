# Tensile Test Primary Data

This [data/primary_data section](https://github.com/materialdigital/application-ontologies/tree/main/tensile_test_ontology_TTO/data/primary_data) 
in the [GitHub repository of the tensile test ontology](https://github.com/materialdigital/application-ontologies/tree/main/tensile_test_ontology_TTO)
comprises classic data files as obtained from a usual tensile test. The files are given in CSV data format. 
The data were obtained from tensile tests performed on an arbitrarily selected conventional S355 steel plate. 

The resulting data is also available in an open [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/record/6778336).
The data was filed again in this repository for an easy and exemplary access, e.g., by workflows computing the data.
